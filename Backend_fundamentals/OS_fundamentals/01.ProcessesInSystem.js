//Processes in Systems

//Process in systems can be simply defined as unit of execution which primarily makes use of required memory space, computational power and processing infra to execute a certain program/set of instructions.

//In nodejs we can see the process by simply writing a few lines as this -

const nodeProcess = process;
console.log(nodeProcess);

//this will give us the details like process version, pid, ppid(parent process ID) etc.
//the process related details can also be viewed on TaskManager (incase of windows OS) ana ActivityMonitor (in case of macOS).
