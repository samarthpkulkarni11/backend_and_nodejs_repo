`So let us start from absolute basics, so what the heck is backend?

backend is nothing but a server or a machine like computer, mobile, laptop or a heck of dollars with machine which can handle/serve the requests and send some response back to the request

if my laptop/mobile/computer is configured to handle the requests incoming and just print "Hey Hello from server" to every request being mapped can be technically called as server or a very basic simple backend system. 

For example - We all use youtube. Now youtube has heck a lot of features and options to play around with, one of the main and biggest feature is to watch suggested videos, search videos based on the categories or specific name so where are these videos coming from, what the heck is happening whenever we click on any video it basically loads
up and gives us some video which is playing the content in that video all of this is happening due to the backend system where in a server is basically serving our requests and sends you back the response on your request.`;

//CLI v/s GUI

`These two are basically kind of applications like for example the CLI stands for command line interface
and GUI stands for Graphical User Interface
Example - Chrome as an application is a GUI application which has some appearence, buttons, layout, color and all those things which does not look boring/1923 kind of application but looks clean enriched with features whereas
Terminal as a CLI application basically does not have much to show up/prebuilt features but just accepts commands to hit different operations and does some examples of job like uploading, downloading, surfing etc`;
